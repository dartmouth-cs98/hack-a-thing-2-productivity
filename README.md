# CS98 Hack a Thing 2
By: Yeonjae Park and Alan Lu

For our Hack a Thing 2 project, we are continuing to explore Unity but working specifically on a 2D RPG game. Last time we focused on following more guided tutorials and explored 3 different games. This time we are following a looser tutorial to better Unity's tilemap system and fine tune our skills.

## Tutorial: https://www.raywenderlich.com/23-introduction-to-the-new-unity-2d-tilemap-system
This was our base tutorial and was worked on by both Yeonjae and I. We learned the basics of using a tilemap in Unity and the 2D camera. We followed the tutorial to create our own simple dungeon map, and then added traps that killed your player. Knowing basically nothing about tilemap games before, this tutorial taught us the Unity built-in tilemap system. This tutorial was relatively straightforward, but we did have some struggles with tile layer order, which we quickly fixed by changing the layer order.

The first tutorial taught us the basics of using the tile system, but didn't implement combat or spells or anything else cool. As a result, we switched to this tutorial and learned more about how to implement a proper health, combat, and spell system. If we had more time, we could have also implemented an inventory and quest system. Still, it was definitely cool to see our spells fully functioning and attacking enemy skeletons.

Ultimately, these two Unity hack-a-things have definitely inspired us as we have been interested in game development for a while but haven't had the opportunity to really play around with game dev. It is possible we will pursue a game idea for our project, but most likely we will end up making an app or something as we currently do not have an idea for a game we like.
